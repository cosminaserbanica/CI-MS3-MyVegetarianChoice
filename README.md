## UX 
### Project Goals
The main goal of **My Vegetarian Choice** is to provide a web-based application, that is simplistic and intuitive in design, which allows users to **create**, **search**, **update** and share their **favourite** vegetarian recipes.

This is the third of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during their Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements were to build a full-stack web application that allows users to manage a common dataset (in this instance, vegetarian recipes) using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Flask** and **MongoDB**.

#### User Goals
The user is looking for:
- A database where the user can find recipes.
- An easy-to-use user management system with **CRUD** conventions to:

    - Create a user account.
    - Update their passord.
    - Delete their user account.

- An easy-to-use dataset management system with **CRUD** conventions to:

    - Create recipes.
    - Read recipes.
    - Update their own recipes.
    - Delete their own recipes.

- A simple and easy to navigate design.

#### Developer Goals
As a developer, I am looking to:

- Create an application where users can post, edit and delete their own recipes.
- Add a new application to my portfolio.
- Improve my newly learned languages and skills.

### User Stories
**As a General User, I want to:**

1. Easily find recipes on the database. 
2. View the details of each recipe.

**As a Non-Registered User, I want to:**

1. Register an account.

**As a Registered User, I want to:**

1. Log into my account to be able to create, edit and delete recipes.
2. Navigate to my user profile to change my password.
3. Navigate to my account settings to delete my account.
4. Navigate to my recipes page to view my uploaded recipes.
6. Navigate to my own recipes to edit recipe as needed.
7. Navigate to my own recipes to delete recipe.

**As an Administrative Account holder, I want to:**

1. Edit **any** recipes created by users.
2. Delete **any** recipes from the dashboard.
